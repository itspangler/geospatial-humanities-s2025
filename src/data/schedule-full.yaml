  subtitle: Aesthetics and politics in mapping
  abstract: What are the best practices for representing spatial data and making maps? To what extent are those practices contingent on flexible cultural and social norms? When should you bend or break these rules in order to make a more effective argument? Is cartography an ‚Äúart,‚Äù a ‚Äúscience,‚Äù something in between, or neither? Is cartography anything at all?
