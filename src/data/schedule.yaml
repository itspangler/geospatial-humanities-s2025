  title: Distortion
  subtitle: Squashing globes and bending lines
  abstract: How do we go about displaying round earth as a flat map? What are the basic mathematical and geodetic rules associated with this process? What sacrifices do we have to make in order to “flatten” the globe, and how have those sacrifices been used strategically?

  title: Design I
  subtitle: Aesthetics and politics in mapping
  abstract: What are the best practices for representing spatial data and making maps? To what extent are those practices contingent on flexible cultural and social norms? When should you bend or break these rules in order to make a more effective argument? Is cartography an “art,” a “science,” something in between, or neither? Is cartography anything at all?
