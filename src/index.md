## Course summary

In recent years, "the humanities" have become increasingly digital.

In this course, we will ask what's "spatial" about the humanities. . We'll sometimes use the term "GIS" (short for "geographic information systems") to describe these geospatial tools. Typically, GIS is defined as a combination of software, data, methods, and hardware with capabilities for manipulating, analyzing, and displaying spatial data. We'll explore spatial data structures, data creation, basic geodesy, spatial analysis, cartographic visualization, and more. Using the software ArcGIS Pro, you will learn how to use these tools effectively. Just as importantly, by incorporating insights from critical archival studies, indigenous and decolonial mapping, feminist geography, and more into your mapping practice, you will learn how to use them *intentionally*.

## Learning objectives and practical skills

Students will learn to use GIS to answer humanistically-informed spatial questions. Detailed labs apply concepts presented in the lectures using a variety of geospatial software in the ArcGIS ecosystem (as well as basic data wrangling literacy in tools like Microsoft Excel). Assignments concentrate on creative applications of concepts covered in lectures and labs, including a final project in which students independently explore a topic from their own field of interest.

Major learning objectives include:

<div class="smaller">

- The coherence (or not) of geospatial humanities as a subset of the humanities in general
- Maps, mapping, and cartography as power-laden processes
- Methods and best practices for interacting with (digital) archives
- Spatial data structures, georeferencing, and geoprocessing
- "x" GIS, including critical, queer, decolonial, feminist, and anti-racist approaches to digital maps & mapping
- Technical skills for problem solving in the context of spatial data
- Approaches and applications of GIS across the humanities
- Basic concepts in spatial databases and queries
- Principles of cartographic design (and when to deviate from them)
- The limits of representation and analysis in GIS
- The limits of GIS itself

</div>

More concretely, by the end of this course, students will be able to do the following:

<div class="smaller">

- Identify data structures in spatial data (rasters or vectors)
- Identify, locate, and acquire spatial data pertinent to projects in their field of interest, as well as pinpoint significant gaps in or problems with existing information
- Evaluate the appropriateness of the existing data sources for use in a given application
- Evaluate spatial (meta)data as simultaneously effects and producers of particular kinds of power geometry
- Understand the data creation process and create historical spatial data sets derived from maps, gazetteers, aerial photography, texts, etc.
- Create spatial data from tabular or textual information that includes a spatial reference
- Describe, design, and use basic spatial databases such as the ArcGIS Pro Catalog (using keys, joins and queries)
- Use appropriate spatial analysis methods for raster and vector data, both independently and combined
- Create high-quality maps and associated graphics/visualizations with text that clearly communicate spatial information and the results of analysis
- Design an independent project that incorporates spatial analysis methods
- Appraise spatial analysis in journal articles
- Evaluate and select appropriate map projection and coordinate system
- Use ArcGIS Pro software with strong proficiency

</div>

## Grading

Grading will be based on a 1000-point scale. You can submit graded activities, labs, assignments up to one week late. Details regarding all course assignments, including requirements for the final project and instructions for curations, will be made available on Canvas.

-  4 labs worth a total of 200 points (50 each)
-  4 skill-building assignments worth a total of 300 points (75 each)
-  Class participation worth 150 points, including in-class and take-home activities
-  The final project worth 250 points
-  A curatorial introduction on a digital geohumanities project, process, or product, worth 100 points and presented in small groups

## Coursework Details

Beyond just showing up to class and paying attention during the lectures, students will develop a geospatial humanities skill set by completing various [activities](#activities), [labs](#labs), and [assignments](#assignments) as well as a [group curation](#curation). This skill set culminates in a [final project](#final-project) on a topic of their choosing.

#### Activities

Nearly every week, we will spend time during class on some kind of activity. Some are bigger and some are smaller. Some are submitted and some are not. Overall, they count towards your participation grade.

#### Labs

Throughout the semester, students will be assigned five labs which explore theories, concepts, and approaches in greater depth. Each lab weaves together methods and concepts, using them in a software application (usually ArcGIS Pro), and application to a particular area of the humanities.

#### Assignments

Assignments concentrate on self-directed application of concepts explored in lectures and labs. Eventually, you will use labs to focus on how geospatial humanities intersect with your own interests, building toward a final project that applies geospatial humanities methods to a topic of your choosing.

#### Curation

Before the end of the semester, you and 2-3 peers will work together on a curation—a deep dive into a geospatial humanities project, process, or product—presenting your findings to the class in roughly 10 minutes.

You should have your group and your curation topic selected by class time on Week 3. [Detailed instructions are available here](curations).

#### Final Project

Beginning officially in Week 8—although you can, and should, start to think about it earlier—you will commence work on a final project. Using concepts and methods learned in class, you'll create and present a large-format infographic presenting original geospatial research into a humanities topic. [Read more about the final project here](final).

Students may choose to exhibit their work at Tufts' GIS Expo day for 10 points (1% of overall grade) of extra credit. The date is TBD, but the Expo will be held from 3-5pm in the Alumnae Lounge of Aidekman Arts Center (40 Talbot Ave). Examples of similar student projects can be found at [Tufts GIS Expo Explorer](https://expoexplorer.it.tufts.edu/).

## Required Readings

You'll have something to read just about every week: this is, after all, a "humanities" course just as well as a "geospatial" one. All readings are  listed in the [schedule](schedule), and they are available through online journal databases open to Tufts students, public web sites, or Canvas.

## Style Guidelines and Citation

All **cartographic work** should adhere, when appropriate, to key principles of map design.

All **written work** should be consistent with the style guidelines of one of the [major style guides](https://researchguides.library.tufts.edu/citation/styles). I have no preference for which one you choose—Chicago, MLA, and APA are all fine—but whatever you select must be applied consistently in your work.

## Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

Tufts University values the diversity of our body of students, staff, and faculty and recognizes the important contribution each student makes to our unique community. Tufts is committed to providing equal access and support to all qualified students through the provision of reasonable accommodations so that each student may fully participate in the Tufts experience. If a student has a disability that requires reasonable accommodations, they should please contact the StAAR Center (formerly Student Accessibility Services) at StaarCenter@tufts.edu or 617-627-4539 to make an appointment with an accessibility representative to determine appropriate accommodations. Please be aware that accommodations cannot be enacted retroactively, making timeliness a critical aspect for their provision.
