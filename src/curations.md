The humanities have always been filled with curatorial activities. The places where objects of the humanities are held and exhibited—like museums, galleries, and libraries—are motivated by curation. Libraries and museums can't keep everything, and what they *do* keep must be routinely [weeded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weeding_(library)) to make space for new things.

Today, the humanities are changing. Everything is digital first. "Collections as data" transform the vast expanse of human knowledge into structured, queryable information.

But you are also the object of curation: you curate certain aspects of your life for different digital platforms, filtering and selecting certain aspects to highlight depending on the platform. You're also the *object* of curation; you have a "digital doppelgänger" that may or may feel familiar to you, depending on how you use it, which attracts targeted advertising, exists as a profile of sellable products or information and news etc.

## Collect yourself

How do you put your physical and digital self on display? What kind of information about you is gathered and collected? Who's doing it and why? What's the value of that information? How does it affect the things that others curate to you (e.g., content, news, etc.) and what you curate to other people?
