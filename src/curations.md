## Introduction

This project invites you to creatively reflect on a core part of the humanities: curation. However, . Here, I don't mean "the humanities" in a detached antiquarian sense (which is to say, crinkled paper, archival materials, literary texts, and so on). Instead, think about "the humanities" as the objects and process which enable you to *be human* in an increasingly digital (and geospatial) world. By examining how you curate , you'll identify the spatiality of the humanities in your everyday life.

## Why curation?

Curation 

The places where objects of the humanities are held and exhibited—like museums, galleries, and libraries—are motivated by curation. Libraries and museums can't keep everything, and what they *do* keep must be routinely [weeded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weeding_(library)) to make space for new things.

Today, the humanities are changing. Everything is digital first. "Collections as data" transform the vast expanse of human knowledge into structured, queryable information.

But you are also the object of curation: you curate certain aspects of your life for different digital platforms, filtering and selecting certain aspects to highlight depending on the platform. You're also the *object* of curation; you have a "digital doppelgänger" that may or may feel familiar to you, depending on how you use it, which attracts targeted advertising, exists as a profile of sellable products or information and news etc.

How do you put your physical and digital self on display? What kind of information about you is gathered and collected? Who's doing it and why? What's the value of that information? How does it affect the things that others curate to you (e.g., content, news, etc.) and what you curate to other people?

What's "human" about the humanities? Where do the humanities appear in your everyday life? What's at stake in the proliferation of geospatiality in the humanities; what might we have to gain or lose?

## Collect yourself

Invitation to reflect creatively on the curatorial impulse; to engage with the geo/spatiality of the humanities, not "humanities" in a detached antiquarian sense but in the sense of the actual reality of your everyday life, the experience of "being human" in a digital---and indeed, a geospatial---world

# Scratch pad

- how do you curate and how do others curate for you?
  - track & reflect on your ecosystem of apps
  - or maybe dive into the conditions of curation - why you make the choices that you do & how it compares to the choices that are made by others (people, institutions, companies, etc.) when curating for you
- think back to a disruption in your digital life
- sensory experiences of digital tools (sight, sound, smell (?), touch, taste (?) - although not really "curatorial")
- think back to a particular moment/experience/etc. when something was digitally "curated" for you
- how does all of this connect to the humanities??? the curatorial impulse at the core of being human, being human-y; e.g., "the human in the humanities"
- i guess it has to happen in different steps

1. How do you curate your everyday digital life?
   1. find some examples of your own curatorial activity---selection, filtering, weeding, etc.
2. How are your own everyday experiences curated for you, by whom, and why?
   1. considering the apps that you use (tiktok insta etc) as part of a bigger structural ecosystem of platform capitalism
   2. but this could also be a reflection of the practices of, e.g., your friends in a group chat

Is there a path forward that uses playhtml??

Olivia
- spatial curation
- "I get all this Thailand content when I'm in Thailand"
- that's how people are getting the news, how they're seeing art, photography; it's all through these algorithms
- it doesn't have to be curated via just social media---like ads on the train!
- maybe walking around! how are things curated in particular fashions when you e.g. walk into different spaces?
  - this reminds her of how power dynamics are structured/organized spatially
- without giving them too many examples that limit their own creativity, they could come up with fun ideas
- to me, that's an assignment that i wouldn't go to ChatGPT 
- maybe tracking where they move?
- Olivia says there's an app, QuickCapture, so they can curate things and show you visually
  - screenshots
  - photographs
